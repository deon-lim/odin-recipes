                Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. 
                Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 
                until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain and transfer into a large bowl.
